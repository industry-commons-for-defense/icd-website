# Software Industry Commons for Defense (SW-ICD) License

**Version 1.0 – May 2025**

## 1. Purpose

The SW-ICD License is designed to enable transparent, modular, and sovereign-aligned software collaboration within the Industry Commons for Defense (ICD). It ensures contributions can be shared across government, FFRDCs, UARCs, and industry without compromising national security, innovation rights, or open-source compatibility.

## 2. Scope

This license governs all software artifacts, including:
- Source code
- Executables
- Libraries
- Containerized environments
- APIs and related interface definitions

It applies to all software developed under or integrated into ICD-governed projects, including those using government-furnished data, platforms, or funding.

## 3. Rights Granted

The Contributor grants to the U.S. Government and all ICD-aligned entities a:
- **Non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, modify, reproduce, test, and redistribute the software
- **Right to sublicense** for mission-critical use, including coalition partners
- **Right to audit and validate** source artifacts and model logic for security or compliance

## 4. Attribution and Lineage

Contributors must provide:
- A clear **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**
- Source and license lineage for all upstream components
- Cryptographic hash of any binary artifact
- Disclosure of any models, weights, or data used in training or inference logic

## 5. Restrictions

Contributors may not:
- Encapsulate open-source or government-funded work as proprietary without disclosure
- Embed call-home, obfuscation, or anti-analysis measures
- Restrict or interfere with red-teaming or operational validation

## 6. Government Purpose Rights

All software developed using ICD funding, data, or infrastructure carries **unlimited rights** as defined by DFARS 252.227-7014 and 10 U.S.C. § 3458. If commingled with proprietary components, those components must be clearly partitioned, auditable, and separately licensed.

## 7. Compliance and Termination

Violations of this license may result in:
- Clawback of rights
- Public release under SW-ICD terms
- Exclusion from future ICD contracting or consortia participation

## 8. Compatibility

This license is compatible with:
- MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0
- GPL and AGPL (provided obligations are passed downstream)
- ICD-Shared Innovation Licenses (hardware and model analogs)

## 9. Jurisdiction

This license is governed by the laws of the United States and enforced under ICD Steering Body authority, with escalation possible to the Department of War Office of General Counsel or Office of the Secretary of War if required.

## 10. Updates and Maintenance

The ICD Steering Body may publish updates to this license. Contributors are encouraged, but not required, to adopt newer versions unless mandated for compliance or interoperability.
