## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at:

**Email**: conduct@icd-defense.org

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

For issues involving potential security concerns or classified information, please contact appropriate security personnel within your organization before external reporting.
